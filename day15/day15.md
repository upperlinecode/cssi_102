# Project Launch!

## Objectives

* Students will ideate and work in collaborative groups.
* Students will synthesize the content they learned throughout this course.

## What We're Building

While you may or may not have used the [Project Mode](../projectMode.md) guide in the earlier mini-projects, it will be critically helpful with this longer project. 

Students will be working in teams for 5 whole days, and so it's important to use this Friday project launch to really lay a solid foundation. Even if you haven't demanded mockups, wireframes, value propositions, or anything similar up until now, today is the perfect day to reframe the conversation.

Ask students not just what they want to build, but what problems they want to solve, and set a very achievable goal for this first day of work - it might just be a mockup of their application's home page. 

Depending on how students have done with Cloud Shell, Firebase, and Git so far, some students may be ready to try collaborating via Git branches, but others may be better off having front-end team members work in Glitch, and having back-end team members work in Cloud Shell, with designated times at the end of each working period to talk about and reintegrate their work. 

Whatever workflow you decide is best for your students, be ready for them to get stuck and frustrated, and remind them that this is about the long-haul over an entire week, not just about what we can accomplish in a single day.
