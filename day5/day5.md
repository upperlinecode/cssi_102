# Mini-Project 1: HTML site (With Bulma and JavaScript)

## Objectives

* Students will ideate and work in collaborative groups.
* Students will synthesize the content they learned in days 1-4 of this course.

## What We're Building

Students should work together to build whatever they want - it is advisable to follow the protocols set forth in the [Project Mode](../projectMode.md) guide with respect to ideation, but skip the more drawn out group formation pieces. Simply assign groups randomly and send students on their way.

Note: Students will not likely use all topics covered so far in their projects - some may not even use JavaScript at all. That's okay! The goal of this project day is for students to feel proud of what they've built, and to deepen friendships with their project partners. There will be plenty of opportunities to dig deeper into JavaScript in the coming weeks. 

Share the following links with students, to give them a idea of the scope of project they should be aiming to build.

## Notes on Friday

Fridays, especially the first and second Fridays of the course, are intentionally designed with no new content. These "flex days" are critical for student success - the extra time spent without the addition of new material allows them to deepen their understanding by shifting from cognitive to autonomous performance. 

This mini-project sprint that allows them to brainstorm ideas and then try to implement them is one of the best ways to offer a comprehensive review of the topics covered earlier in the week.

That said, if it has become apparent that a specific concept proved more of a stumbling block than was anticipated, that concept is critical to know moving forward,  and a large subset of students are experiencing difficulty with that topic, then **if an instructor wants to offer a review session for that subset of students which covers these topics in a little more detail and formality, the team should try to adjust to make that happen.**
