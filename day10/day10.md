# Dynamic Web App with Firebase Realtime Database

## Objectives

* Students will ideate and work in collaborative groups.
* Students will synthesize the content they learned in days 1-9 of this course.

## What We're Building

Students should work together to build whatever they want to integrate the ideas covered so far in the course - it is advisable to follow the protocols set forth in the [Project Mode](../projectMode.md) guide with respect to ideation, but skip the more drawn out group formation pieces. Simply assign groups (either randomly, or according to the grouping strategy of your choice) and send students on their way.

Note: The exemplars linked below include two different variations on a theme, one of which layers on some sorting as part of its code, and the other of which really just accesses records directly. All students should use a Firebase application for this mini-project, but it's fine if their projects ONLY create or ONLY read records. Before you launch, spend some time brainstorming what types of projects can make the best use of databases in the way we have used them so far (ie. no built-in permissions - anyone can create a record, anyone can read any record).

Share the following links with students, to give them a idea of the scope of project they should be aiming to build.
