# Dynamic Web App with Firebase Realtime Database

## Objectives

* Students will ideate and work in collaborative groups.
* Students will synthesize the content they learned in days 1-9 of this course.

## What We're Building

Students should work together to build whatever they want - it is advisable to follow the protocols set forth in the [Project Mode](project_mode.md) guide with respect to ideation, but skip the more drawn out group formation pieces. Simply assign groups randomly and send students on their way.

Share the following links with students, to give them a idea of the scope of project they should be aiming to build.
