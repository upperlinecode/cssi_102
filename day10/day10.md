# Dynamic Web App with Firebase Realtime Database

## Objectives

* Students will ideate and work in collaborative groups.
* Students will synthesize the content they learned in days 1-9 of this course.

## What We're Building

Students should work together to build whatever they want to integrate the ideas covered so far in the course - it is advisable to follow the protocols set forth in the [Project Mode](../projectMode.md) guide with respect to ideation, but skip the more drawn out group formation pieces. Simply assign groups (either randomly, or according to the simpler grouping strategy of your choice) and send students on their way.

At this point, Cloud Shell does not allow for teletype collaboration, so students will likely want to work together in one of two ways - either screenshare and driver-navigator all day while sending code snippets back and forth through email or a similar service, or dividing the work into front- and back-end halves, and sharing the front-end through Glitch while the back-end engineer takes that code and integrates it into their Cloud Shell Firebase app. 

NOTE: The exemplars linked below include two different variations on a theme, one of which layers on some sorting as part of its code, and the other of which really just accesses records directly. All students should use a Firebase application for this mini-project, but it's fine if their projects ONLY create or ONLY read records. Before you launch, spend some time brainstorming what types of projects can make the best use of databases in the way we have used them so far (ie. no built-in permissions - anyone can create a record, anyone can read any record).

Share the following links with students, to give them a idea of the scope of project they should be aiming to build.

## Quick refresher on creating a Firebase Project

Students may benefit from a quick refresher on how to create a Firebase project in the Firebase console, and how to initialize it in their project directory. Refer to Part 2 of the <a href="/day7/day7.md">day 7 lesson </a>for a stepped solution on how to create a Firebase project and set up a Realtime Database in the Firebase console. Reference the <a href="/day8/day8.md">day 8 lesson</a> for a stepped guide on how to initialize Firebase in a project directory.

## Notes on Friday

Fridays, especially the first and second Fridays of the course, are intentionally designed with no new content. These "flex days" are critical for student success - the extra time spent without the addition of new material allows them to deepen their understanding by shifting from cognitive to autonomous performance. 

This mini-project sprint that allows them to brainstorm ideas and then try to implement them is one of the best ways to offer a comprehensive review of the topics covered earlier in the week.

That said, if it has become apparent that a specific concept proved more of a stumbling block than was anticipated, that concept is critical to know moving forward,  and a large subset of students are experiencing difficulty with that topic, then **if an instructor wants to offer a review session for that subset of students which covers these topics in a little more detail and formality, the team should try to adjust to make that happen.**
